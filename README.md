# 💫 About Me:

**Product Security Specialist | 9+ Years Protecting Healthcare, Med-Tech & Aerospace**

I do the unglamorous but critical work of ensuring complex systems stay secure. From designing resilient architectures to threat modeling and vulnerability assessments, my goal is simple: find the holes and fix them before someone else does.

I have a deep history with regulatory landscapes—**FDA, HIPAA, and NIST** are my standard operating environments. I’m hands-on with the modern security stack (**SAST, SCA/SBOM, BlackDuck, Azure Cloud**) and experienced in coordinating penetration tests that yield results, not surprises.

My philosophy? Security shouldn't be an afterthought. I partner with R&D teams to bake security into the development lifecycle from day one, ensuring that large-scale healthcare systems are secure by design, not by accident.

Core Expertise: **Product Security • Compliance (CFR/HIPAA) • Threat Modeling • Identity Management • Vulnerability Lifecycle**
