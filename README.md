# 💫 About Me:

**Product Security Specialist** with 9+ years of doing the unglamorous but critical work of keeping things from getting hacked across Healthcare, Med-Tech, IT, and Aerospace. I design secure architectures, poke holes in systems with threat modeling and vulnerability assessments, then fix them before someone else finds them first.

Very familiar with the joy of regulatory compliance, yes FDA, HIPAA, NIST, we’ve met many times. Hands-on with SAST, SCA/SBOM using BlackDuck, Azure cloud security, and coordinating penetration tests so surprises only happen in movies.

I spend a lot of time working with R&D teams to bake security into the development lifecycle instead of slapping it on at the end and pretending everything is fine, especially for large, complex healthcare systems.
